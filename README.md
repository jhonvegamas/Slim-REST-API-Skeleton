Slim is a PHP micro-framework that helps you quickly write simple yet powerful web applications and APIs.

## Slim Framework 3 Skeleton Application for API's

Use this skeleton application to quickly setup and start working on a new Slim Framework 3 application. This application uses the latest Slim 3 with the PHP-View template renderer. It also uses the Monolog logger.

This skeleton application was built for Composer. This makes setting up a new Slim Framework application quick and easy.


## Install the Application

Run this command from the directory in which you want to download your new Slim Framework application.

https://github.com/jhonvegamas/Slim-Skeleton/archive/master.zip

Replace `[my-app-name]` with the desired directory name for your new application. You'll want to:

* Point your virtual host document root to your new application's `public/` directory.

To run the application in development, you can run these commands 

	cd [my-app-name]
	php composer.phar start

That's it! Now go build something cool.
